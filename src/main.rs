/// This function is called when the application is started. It checks the
/// command line arguments and prints a usage message if there are too few
/// arguments or if the user requested help. Otherwise, it copies the public
/// SSH key to the specified location.
///
/// The public key is read from the file `id_rsa.pub` in the user's
/// home directory. The private key is not used.
///
/// The public key is appended to the file `authorized_keys` in the user's
/// home directory on the remote machine. If the file does not exist, it is
/// created.
///
/// The user is asked to enter their password when connecting to the remote
/// machine. The password is not stored anywhere.

/// # Example
///
/// To copy the public key to the user `matt` on the host `192.168.0.2`, run
/// the following command:
